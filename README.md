# Sudoku

![demo](demo.gif)

This is a project I did as part of SV-College's Front-End development course.
It was done by me and another person.
I was responsible for desiging everything to do with the game and board's logic and behaviour. Including but not limited to the initial creation of the board and the 'hint', 'check', 'solve' mechanisms.

Features:

- Guest and User entrances: A registered user will be able to choose a difficulty, while a guest can only play in easy mode.

-Difficulty settings: The user may choose between 3 difficulty settings, which affects the number of hidden tiles on the board as well as the number of hints available to the user. ie:
Easy: 20 tiles hidden, 5 hints available.
Normal: 40 tiles hidden, 4 hints available.
Hard: 60 tiles hidden, 3 hints available.
Empty: A completely empty board, no hints. Used in case a user wants, for example, to solve a Sudoku game from a newspaper or other source they may be stuck on. So they can replicate it using the Empty setting and get hints or even a full solution using this app's features.
